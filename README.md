## Introduction 
A game for SUTD Course 50.003, Elements of Software Construction. 

The idea is to create a real-time multiplayer game that is both fun and engaging :D 

## How to run the code 
Import the project to Android Studio, connect to your android phone, and click on the "Run App" button (a green arrow). 

Make sure the android phone is on developer mode and allows debugging! 

## Game overview and rules 
This is a multiplayer game, where 2 to 4 players compete to achieve the end goal. 

The aim of the game is to get to a desired end number. Starting from a value of 0, your character will go on collecting items (made of numbers and operations, for example "+1"). These will add on, or change your character's value. 

This will go on until one player reaches the desired number.
