## Introduction 
A game for SUTD Course 50.003, Elements of Software Construction. 

The idea is to create a real-time multiplayer game that is both fun and engaging :D 

## Game overview and rules 
This is a multiplayer game, where 2 to 4 players compete to achieve the end goal. 

The aim of the game is to get to a desired end number. Starting from a value of 0, your character will go on collecting items (made of numbers and operations, for example "+1"). These will add on, or change your character's value. 

This will go on until one player reaches the desired number.
